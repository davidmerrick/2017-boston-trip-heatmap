This is a set of scripts to streamline the process of creating a heatmap from geotagged images.

## Prerequisites

This requires Docker and a Google Maps JS API key.
Docker: https://www.docker.com/

## Usage

1. Put your images in the "img" folder.
2. Run the run.sh script.
3. Enter your Google Maps JS API key.

And that's it!
