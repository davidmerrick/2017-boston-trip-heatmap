This is a set of scripts to streamline the process of creating a heatmap from geotagged images.

## Todo

- This is currently a work-in-progress. I do have a working project [here](https://github.com/davidmerrick/exif-heatmaps) that uses Google Maps.
- Simplify this project. Just have it serve up the geoJSON. Have a separate repo for pulling the EXIF data off the photos.
